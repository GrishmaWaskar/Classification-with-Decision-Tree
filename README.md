# Classification-with-Decision-Tree

# Introduction
- This project addresses the challenge of predicting purchase behavior by analyzing a dataset containing information on gender, age, salary, and purchase history.
- Through a systematic approach encompassing data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, and evaluation.

#  Objective of Project
- The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist businesses in identifying potential customers likely to make a purchase.
- By analyzing demographic information such as gender, age, and salary, the model aims to provide insights into customer behavior and preferences.

# Solution
The solution involves the following steps:

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
- Gathered dataset containing gender, age, salary, and purchase history.
- Preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Conducted EDA to understand
- data distribution, relationships between features, and patterns.
- Visualized the data using seaborn to gain insights.

## 3. Model Selection and Training:
- Selected a Decision Tree Classifier model for purchase prediction.
- Split the data into training and validation sets, trained the model, and evaluated its performance using appropriate metrics.

## 4. Inference:
- Used the trained model to make predictions on new data and interpret. 

# Business Impact
The predictive model developed in this project can have several business impacts, including:
- Targeted Marketing: Businesses can use the model to identify potential customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
- Resource Allocation: By predicting purchase likelihood, businesses can allocate resources more efficiently, focusing on customers with higher propensity to buy.
- Customer Segmentation: The model can assist in segmenting customers based on their likelihood to purchase, allowing for personalized customer experiences.

# Tools
